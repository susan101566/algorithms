My first year finishing AOC! 
It's a lot more accessible than the 2019 version, where I gave up after day 17. 
As much as I struggled back then, I personally liked the harder problems better, as it felt more rewarding for my daily commitments. 
This year, day 20 bestowed me with that feeling. Perhaps that's the meta, to highlight the unique struggles 2020 has brought to this world. 
Or perhaps it's really by the mercy of the author, that I barely had to stay one hour past 9pm every night during this typically demanding month. 
I thank them, as well as the 32 people on my leaderboard for virtually keeping me company. 
Merry Christmas to you all :)
